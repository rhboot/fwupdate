fwupdate
--------

*This project is no longer supported.*

All code has been merged directly into the [fwupd](https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd) project.

Please switch to that.

NOTE: If you must maintain `fwupdate` for a LTS distribution, some Linux distributions have
developed support for [SBAT](https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.example.md) on
the [security branch](https://github.com/rhboot/fwupdate/tree/security)
