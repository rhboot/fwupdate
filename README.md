UEFI firmware capsules for Linux
--------
This project provides the pieces needed to flash an industry standard UEFI capsule in a Linux OS.
It also aims to be compatible with some implementation decisions that were made in Windows.

The following binaries are produced:
 * `libfwup` library providing APIs to do UEFI updates for other applications
 * `fwupdate` command line tool
 * `fwup.efi` EFI application used for flashing the update from EFI.

## Normal flow
UEFI capsule updates are _not_ actually flashed within Linux.  They're staged for update to
be installed on the next boot.

1. A higher level tool such as [fwupd](https://github.com/hughsie/fwupd) will consume a _.CAB_ file.
2. That tool will use libfwup from this project to stage the updates on the system.
3. `libfwup` will copy the payload to the EFI system partition.
4. `libfwup` will create EFI NVRAM entries pointing to the correct payload on the EFI system partition.
5. `libfwup` will create a new EFI Boot entry to launch the firmware updating EFI application.
6. `libfwup` will set the `BootNext` variable to run that application on next boot.
7. The user will reboot the system.
8. The `fwup.efi` application will examine EFI NVRAM entries to find capsules previously staged.
9. The `fwup.efi` applciation will call the BIOS `UpdateCapsule()` method to flash the capsules.
10. The BIOS will flash the capsules and then reboot back into the OS.

## Usage
UEFI capsule updates are typically distributed by services such as [LVFS](https://fwupd.org) in _.CAB_ format.  The command line tool provided by this project works directly on the
payload stored in the *.CAB*.
Most users should apply UEFI capsule updates with a higher level tool such as [fwupd](https://github.com/hughsie/fwupd) that uses the library `libfwup` that is provided by this project.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are needed to compile:
 * libpopt
 * efivar (>=33)
 * gnu-efi (>= 3.0.2)
 * elfutils

Optionally if libsmbios is present some additional features on Dell systems can be enabled
as well.

## Compiling

Optionally set the EFI system partition mount point.  If not configured it will default to `/boot/efi`
```
# git config fwupdate.espmountdir $DIRECTORY
```

Set the EFI subdirectory directory that EFI binaries are installed into.
```
# git config fwupdate.efidir $DIRECTORY
```
This usually refers to the OS distributor.  For example on Ubuntu it's set to *ubuntu*

Run the build command
```
# make
```

Run the install command
```
# make install
```

## Other notes
Some distributions don't use the same paths for the dependencies as in Make.defaults.
For example on Debian and Ubuntu you need to override `GNUEFIDIR` to the correct path.

## Command line
Checking if UEFI capsule updates are supported:
```
# fwupdate --supported
```

Checking which ESRT GUIDs are on the system:
```
# fwupdate --list
```

Display details of all ESRT entries:
```
# fwupdate --info
```

Applying a payload:
```
# fwupdate --apply=<guid> <payload>
```

Enable firmware updates on supported Dell systems (if compiled with libsmbios):
```
# fwupdate --enable
```
